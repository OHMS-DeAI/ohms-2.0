## üéØ Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Transform OHMS from a single-agent inference platform into the world's first subscription-based autonomous agent platform with democratized NOVAQ technology, where anyone can access advanced model compression and users create intelligent agents from natural language instructions.

### Current State vs Future State
**OHMS 1.0 (Current):**
- Single-agent inference using APQ quantization
- Direct model access without admin controls
- No subscription economics or user quotas
- Limited to basic inference tasks
- OISY wallet authentication with reliability issues

**OHMS 2.0 (Target):**
- Instruction-based autonomous agent creation
- Publicly accessible NOVAQ compression (93-100x compression)
- Subscription tiers with quota enforcement for OHMS platform
- Self-coordinating multi-agent networks
- Complete on-chain inference with economic activity
- Democratic access to advanced AI compression technology
- **Internet Identity v2 + Stripe integration** for modern authentication and payments

### Market Opportunity
The autonomous agent market lacks:
- **Accessible Creation**: Users need programming skills to create agents
- **Democratized Compression**: Advanced AI compression technology is locked behind corporate walls
- **Economic Sustainability**: Free platforms are unsustainable at scale
- **True Autonomy**: Current agents require constant user intervention
- **Open AI Infrastructure**: No platform combines accessible compression with agent creation
- **Modern Authentication**: Reliable, user-friendly authentication with payment integration
