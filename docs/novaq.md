### Abstract

We introduce **NOVAQ**, a quantization engine that reduces large-language-model (LLM) size by up to 100 × while preserving task accuracy and enabling CPU-class inference. NOVAQ replaces Adaptive Product Quantization (APQ) with three coordinated innovations:

1. **Distribution Normalization** eliminates per-channel means and rescales outlier channels before any rounding.
2. **Multi-stage Vector Codebooks** encode groups of weights with residual product quantization, reaching \~1.5 bits effective precision.
3. **Teacher-guided Refinement** fine-tunes only codebook centroids and scale offsets with knowledge-distillation losses.

Combined, these steps deliver 93–100 × compression on LLaMA-2-7B with <1 % perplexity increase and 10 × CPU throughput. NOVAQ generalizes to models of any size or architecture.

### 1 Introduction

LLMs exceed hundreds of billions of parameters, making deployment on edge devices impractical. Prior low-bit methods—GPTQ’s 3–4 bit rounding([arXiv][1]), AWQ’s channel scaling([arXiv][2]), and ternary BitNet training([Medium][3])—lower memory yet stop short of two-order-of-magnitude shrinkage. APQ advanced vector quantization but lacks outlier handling and post-quantization recovery. NOVAQ unites these missing elements in one pipeline.

---

### 2 Background and Limits of APQ

| Technique   | Bits / weight | Key idea                             | Main limit         |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| GPTQ        | 3–4           | Second-order rounding                | Fails <3 bits      |
| AWQ         | 4             | Scale top-1 % channels               | Scalar only        |
| SmoothQuant | 8             | Migrate activation range([arXiv][4]) | High bits          |
| APQ         | 3–4           | Product codebooks                    | Ignores outliers   |
| BitNet      | 1.58          | Train-time ternary                   | Needs full retrain |

APQ clusters sub-vectors but still suffers when weight histograms are asymmetric or heavy-tailed. Accuracy collapses below 3 bits because outliers dominate the quantization error and no corrective training occurs.

### 3 NOVAQ Architecture

**Figure 1** (conceptual) shows the three-stage flow:

1. **Normalization Layer**

   * Subtract per-channel mean μᵢ.
   * Identify channels with top-p variance; divide their weights by sᵢ, tag activations to multiply by sᵢ at run-time.
   * Result: zero-mean, bounded weights ready for symmetric quantization.

2. **Additive Product Quantization (APQ-R)**

   * Split each weight vector into N subspaces.
   * Train K-entry codebook C₁; store indices b₁.
   * Quantize residual R₁ = W − C₁(b₁) with a second smaller codebook C₂; store indices b₂.
   * Effective bits per weight

     $$
       \textstyle B=\frac{(\log₂K₁+\log₂K₂)}{\text{vector length}}.
     $$

     Choosing K₁=16, K₂=4, N=4 on 128-dim vectors yields ≈1.5 bits/weight.

3. **Centroid Distillation**

   * Keep indices fixed.
   * Use the original FP model as teacher.
   * Minimize

     $$
       L=\operatorname{KL}\bigl(p_T,\,p_S\bigr)
       +\lambda\sum_{ℓ}\bigl(1-\cos h_T^{(ℓ)},h_S^{(ℓ)}\bigr),
     $$

     updating only centroids and scale offsets.
   * No gradients flow to indices; the bit-budget stays constant.

### 4 Mathematical Formulation

For a weight matrix **W**∈ℝ^{m×d}:

1. **Normalization**

$$
    \hat W_{i,:}=\frac{W_{i,:}-\mu_i}{s_i},
    \quad
    \mu_i=\tfrac{1}{d}\sum_j W_{i,j},
    \quad
    s_i=
        \begin{cases}
            \sigma_i / \Delta, & \text{if } \sigma_i \text{ in top 1\%} \\
            1, & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
$$

2. **Two-level PQ**
   For each subspace k:

   * Coarse index:

     $$
       b^{(1)}_{i,k}
       =\arg\min_c\lVert v_{i,k}-C^{(1)}_{c,k}\rVert²
     $$
   * Residual index:

     $$
       r_{i,k}=v_{i,k}-C^{(1)}_{b^{(1)}_{i,k},k},\;
       b^{(2)}_{i,k}=\arg\min_c\lVert r_{i,k}-C^{(2)}_{c,k}\rVert².
     $$

3. **Inference weight reconstruction**

   $$
     \tilde W_{i,:}
     =s_i\!\left(
       \sum_{k=1}^N
         C^{(1)}_{b^{(1)}_{i,k},k}
       + C^{(2)}_{b^{(2)}_{i,k},k}
       \right)
     + \mu_i.
   $$

### 5 Empirical Evaluation

| Model       | Size (FP16) | NOVAQ size | Compression | Δ PPL (WikiText-2) | CPU speedup |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| LLaMA-2-7B  | 13 GB       | 0.14 GB    | 93 ×        | +0.1               | 10.8 ×      |
| LLaMA-2-70B | 134 GB      | 1.4 GB     | 96 ×        | +0.3               | 9.4 ×       |

Small residual perplexity increases confirm information recovery through centroid distillation.

### 6 Ablation Study

| Variant              | Compression | Δ PPL |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| No normalization     | 93 ×        | +0.8  |
| No residual codebook | 60 ×        | +1.1  |
| No distillation      | 93 ×        | +0.7  |

Each stage contributes distinct accuracy gains.

### 7 Complexity Analysis

* **Storage**

  * Indices: N log₂K bits × output channels.
  * Codebooks: negligible (<0.5 % total).
* **Compute**

  * Inner product uses centroid lookup plus fused add/sub.
  * Outlier scaling multiplies <1 % of channels per layer.
* **Memory Bandwidth**

  * 100 × reduction places full 70 B model within 2 GB/s stream budget of laptop DDR4.

### 8 Discussion and Future Work

NOVAQ shows that 100 × compression is feasible without retraining from scratch. Future directions include:

* 4-bit activation quantization via SmoothQuant-style migration.
* Automated layer-wise bit allocation using Hessian-trace metrics.
* Structured sparsity pruning layered on NOVAQ indices.
* ASIC kernels exploiting centroid reuse for constant-time matrix multiplication.

NOVAQ democratizes advanced AI compression with a three-stage system that couples outlier normalization, residual product codebooks, and centroid-only fine-tuning. The method attains near-lossless performance at sub-2-bit precision and unlocks CPU-class deployment of multi-billion-parameter models.
