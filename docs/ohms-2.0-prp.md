### Gotchas
⚠️ **Critical Implementation Considerations:**
- **ICP Memory Constraints**: Canister memory constraints require careful shard management and lazy loading
- **NOVAQ Processing**: Requires three-stage pipeline and teacher-guided refinement with PyTorch
- **Multi-Level Quotas**: Agent quotas must be enforced at creation, token usage, and inference rate levels
- **II v2 Integration**: Real principal extraction and session management require careful UX design
- **Identity Management**: Principal-based authentication and session continuity require robust data modeling
- **Agent Coordination**: Autonomous agents need self-coordination without infinite loops or resource exhaustion
- **Security Boundaries**: Model APIs must be accessible to users without exposing admin controls
- **Realistic Compression**: NOVAQ achieves 93-100x compression, not aspirational 1000x claims
- **Authentication Persistence**: Cross-session authentication continuity requires robust session management
- **Principal Authentication**: Real II v2 principal extraction and validation requires proper certificate handling

### Current State
OHMS 1.0 exists with all six repositories but configured for single-agent inference using APQ. NOVAQ technology supersedes APQ and needs implementation. Complete refactoring required for admin-user separation and subscription economics. OISY wallet authentication needs replacement with Internet Identity v2 for secure authentication.
